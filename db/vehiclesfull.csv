Proudly Serving The Northwest for 96 Years!!!  Reviews:   * With its reputation for reliability, safety, comfort and excellent resale still intact, the 2014 Honda Civic remains one of the best small-car values around. Be it the standard sedan, sporty coupe, racy Si trim, frugal hybrid or ultra-clean CNG model, there is a Civic to meet almost any demand. Source: KBB.com   * Redesigned for 2014 the Honda Civic is back to rest the critics of the past. Whichever Civic you choose, you'll find the technology and refinement to make the journey more exciting than the destination. A new front grille and headlights adorn the front end, while new taillights help you stand out from behind. Add to that its wheel options and you've got the sleekest Civic yet. The 1.8L, single overhead camshaft, aluminum-alloy i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine uses state of the art engineering technology to produce an impressive 143hp, yet it still receives excellent fuel-efficiency ratings and a Partial Zero-Emission Vehicle rating, all on regular gasoline. Honda's new Earth Dreams continuously variable transmission (CVT) provides an outstanding driving experience. The CVT allows the engine to always operate at the most efficient rpm level, enabling maximum efficiency under all driving conditions. Interior features include an impressive array of available tech features including an available 7-inch display audio with a touch-screen interface; the Honda LaneWatch system which activates a tiny camera on the passenger side mirror when you signal to change lanes to cover more view than the passenger-side mirror; HondaLink's Aha app allows you to access news, social media, restaurant searches, internet radio, and more; a rearview camera is available with up to 3 available angles to view; Satellite navigation is also available with voice recognition software. The Civic's Advanced Compatibility Engineering II body structure is a Honda-exclusive body design that enhances occupant protection and crash compatibility in frontal collisions. The ACE design utilizes a network of connected structural elements to distribute crash energy more evenly throughout the front of the vehicle. This enhanced frontal crash-energy management helps to reduce the forces transferred to the passenger compartment and can help to more evenly disperse the forces transferred to other vehicles in a crash.

6000,1948,jeep,,good,4 cylinders,gas,41644,002A207783,4wd,SUV,"1948 Willys CJ2A – $6000. This rare “flat fender” jeep has a rebuilt engine, new OEM carb, new tires, front springs, exhaust, new brake lines, wheel cylinders and master cylinder.  I have checked and lubed the front and rear axles, and driven it around the block after putting it back together for my winter project. I got this years ago as a complete “field find” and would run. It had been converted to 12V with alternator. However, I noticed milky oil due to head gasket leakage, and it had no brakes. The engine was pulled and inspected, cleaned and found cylinders had been bored and the pistons/rings in good shape. It was then reassembled with new bearings and gaskets.  I replaced the master cylinder, all the brake lines and installed new wheel cylinders. I did not replace the old drums and brake shoes.  I cleaned and repacked the front hubs/wheel bearings and the front and rear differentials covers were pulled to inspect gears and add new gear oil. This winter it was further restored with a new carburetor, new exhaust system, new tires, and new front springs/shackles. The rusty floor was treated and painted with POR15 and the body was sanded and hand painted with red rustoleum.  It starts easily and I have driven it around the block, but needs additional work before being “road worthy” such as new brake drums/shoes, wiring for lights and gauges, and oil leaks from the tranny/transfer case.  I need to move on to other projects - $6000.  Call or text Bill at 208- two zero one- 5175. No trades or emails.",,id,43.7263,-111.1199,east idaho

From Wikipedia Ford basics for the Crown Victoria 19551956[edit]See also: 1955 Ford, Ford Fairlane Crown Victoria, and Ford Fairlane Crown Victoria SkylinerFor 1955, the Ford Fairlane was introduced as the premium Ford model range. Slotted above the Victoria two-door hardtop, the Crown Victoria debuted as the flagship trim of the Fairlane. In place of the popular hardtop roofline, the Crown Victoria was fitted with a B-pillared roofline. Similar to the Mercury XM-800 concept car (though changed in angle), the B-pillar was fitted with a wide stainless steel band (""crowning"" the roof), giving a sleeker appearance to the roofline.Alongside the standard two-tone roof, the Crown Victoria Skyliner was fitted with a fixed sunroof, a tinted acrylic glass panel formed the entire roof ahead of the B-pillar.[5]For 1956, the Lifeguard option package was introduced as an option for the Fairlane Crown Victoria (as with all Ford cars).[6]For the 1957 redesign of the Ford model line, the Crown Victoria was retired from the Fairlane series with no replacement.

As such it was, and remains, a rust-free example of the marque. This Monza coupe example was originally assembled with Chevrolet’s 2-speed automatic transmission, but was upgraded to a factory four speed manual transmission during restoration making it a sportier touring ride.   Sure to get lots of positive interest, this Regal Red example will be a great car for your Cars and Coffee Saturday morning meet. Or that Show and Shine event nearby this summer. And with its sporty handling due to quick ratio steering upgrade, it will be a great car for carving those backroads through the countryside. The Corvair hardtop coupe offers great flow-through ventilation with the windows down and vents open, while still offering great protection from harsh sunlight. And still, with windows up, there is all the protection you need when the weather takes a turn.   Owner’s manual, shop manual supplement, and receipts for parts and work accompany purchase. Numerous improvements and upgrades were made during restoration including:  Complete repaint in factory correct Regal Red (R-R paint code)  All New Interior including Seat covers and foam cushions Door and rear seat panels Carpet Floor mats Headliner Dash cover Added color matched center console New door, window, trunk, engine hood seals  Engine Overhaul including New .020 over pistons/cylinders, lifters, rockers, bearings, seals, oil pump, blower bearing New clutch and throw-out bearing Resealed transmission and differential Rebuilt carburetors Pertronix Ignitor ignition module New dual exhaust system complete  New Brake System including New Dual Reservoir master cylinder (upgraded from original factory single reservoir) New brake cylinders New brake shoes and associated hardware New parking brake cables  Suspension Rebuild including New shock absorbers New rubber bushings throughout New ball joints Rebuilt steering box New Quick Ratio steering arms New rear wheel bearings and U-joints  Genuine OEM Chevrolet 15x7 Rally Wheels with  OEM Refurbished “Chevrolet Motor Division” center caps New Stainless Steel Beauty Rings New 205 60r15 Fuzion Touring tires",,mn,43.0683,-92.6761,minneapolis / st paul

98500,1970,chevrolet,nova yenko deuce,excellent,8 cylinders,gas,27000,114270W349789,rwd,coupe,"1970 CHEVROLET NOVA YENKO DEUCE—THE REAL THING!!   One of only 175 built and one of 25 with a Forest Green, Code 48, exterior, according to Super Chevy magazine. It rolled off the assembly line during the 4th week of May, 1970. Powered by a COPO LT1 350 engine (casting date of April 1, 1970), a Muncie 4-speed manual (casting date of March 3, 1970), a COPO F41 sport suspension and a 12-bolt differential with an incredibly rare 3.55:1 posi-traction rear end (only 3 examples--generally reserved for the 396/375 L78 Nova).    Today, of the original 175 built, there are only 72 documented to still exist in running order . Of those, there are 13 known examples in Forest Green with only 9 of those sporting the 4-speed transmission. Super Rare “ATLAS MAGS”  complete the legendary Muscle Car look.  The Deuce is listed in both the Yenko Registry and the Copo Connection Registry. The originating dealer was Yenko Chevrolet in Canonsburg, PA. It was then transferred to and sold new at W.R. Austin Motors in Norwalk CT. Vin is 114270W349789.  Recently serviced with all fresh fluids, new “Competition Cams” high strength pushrods and recent solid-lifter valve adjustment. Available original parts come with the car.

Selling ONLY because we are now fully retired and moving to NW Montana where there is just too much snow, rain and a one mile long gravel road to get to the new house--not the proper environment for this rust free Collector car.  I do not need help selling and please do not suggest trades or make foolish lowball offers. This is an exceedingly rare, fully restored, American Muscle car in a strong #2 condition. Recently, a ""Survivor"" Yenko was advertised for $180,000. Outside of auctions, a real Yenko rarely becomes available!",,nv,36.020725,-115.278614,las vegas

Wasn't planning on selling it, but I'll be needing a work truck soon and decided it was time.  Purchased in 2017 and well maintained ever since.  The car has less than typical exterior wear for a 2005 and the inside looks great as well.  The leather is cleaned/conditioned regularly and is in good shape all over with a little wear on front and passenger lower seats.  I have lower seat covers that are a perfect match for the leather pattern on the factory seats (see attached pics).  The car has upgraded brakes with slotted and drilled rotors and ceramic brake pads.  Custom painted red calipers are a nice touch and look great!  The car has aftermarket LED strip signal lights added to bumper and cool white LED lights throughout the interior.  The car was wired for a subwoofer by previous owner and the connections are still in the car (even though I never used one).  Windows are tinted and in great shape.  The headlights have been upgraded and converted to HID which looks great and really makes driving at night easier.  The headlight housing has a super light tint, which doesn't affect brightness, makes it look cooler, but also prevents the dreaded headlight oxidation.  The tires are in great shape and were purchased last year.  When that time does come replacement tires are super reasonably priced at discount tire for like 75$ each (less than I've ever had to pay for other car tires in past).  I have all service records available and have gotten all oil changes when needed.  Car is garage kept at work so it has avoided lots of sunlight over the years.     Overall the car is in excellent shape for a 2005 and has some great little add ons.  The car does need both front Wheel Bearing Hubs replaced soon.  I've had an estimate for 350 plus parts to handle by a mechanic.  Lots of these are listed for 6000 or more online and I've adjusted the price accordingly to handle this repair with some extra wiggle room.   Timing Belt, water pump, oil pump, and oil pump seals replaced in 2017. Battery - about a year old Engine Mount and left axle replaced in 2017 Transmission is flawless and has never given me any trouble.    I would be keeping this car if I didn't need something I can haul stuff around with for work.    8 Speakers,Acura/ELS Prem AM/FM w/XM Satellite Radio,AM/FM radio,Cassette,CD player,DVD-Audio,Premium audio system,Air Conditioning,Automatic temperature control,Front dual zone A/C,Rear window defroster,Memory seat,Power driver seat,Power steering,Power windows,Remote keyless entry,Steering wheel mounted audio controls,Wireless connectivity,Four wheel independent suspension,Speed-sensing steering,Traction control,4-Wheel Disc Brakes,ABS brakes,Dual front impact airbags,Dual front side impact airbags,Front anti-roll bar,Occupant sensing airbag,Overhead airbag,Rear anti-roll bar,Power moonroof,Brake assist,Electronic Stability Control,Front fog lights,High-Intensity Discharge Headlights,Panic alarm,Security system,Speed control,Bumpers: body-color,Heated door mirrors,Power door mirrors,Auto-dimming Rear-View mirror,Driver door bin,Driver vanity mirror,Front Cupholders,Front reading lights,Garage door transmitter: HomeLink,Illuminated entry,Leather Shift Knob,Leather steering wheel,Outside temperature display,Overhead console,Passenger vanity mirror,Rear reading lights,Rear seat center armrest,Tachometer,Telescoping steering wheel,Tilt steering wheel,Trip computer,Front Bucket Seats,Front Heated Sport Bucket Seats,Heated front seats,Perforated Leather Seat Trim,Power passenger seat,Front Center Armrest w/Storage,Passenger door bin,17 x 8 Aluminum Wheels,Alloy wheels,Speed-Sensitive Wipers,Variably intermittent wipers, and more!",,tn,36.0662,-86.9639,nashville

The TL has stolen the spotlight from the RL since 2009, when the TL became available with most of the same technology including Acura's Super Handling All-Wheel Drive, and the same 305-hp 3.7-liter engine that initially made the RL unique. Not only that, but the TL also achieves better fuel economy figures and wears a price tag that's far lower than that of the RL.For 2012, the TL has a new face that's more appealing to the eye than previous model years. The polarizing chrome ""beak"" or ""rhinoceros nose"" has been toned down, giving the front fascia a softer look. The rear has also been updated with added character lines that help break up the mass rear bumper. But perhaps the big news is the addition of a much-needed six-speed automatic transmission.The TL is available as a base model, with SH-AWD, and for enthusiasts, the TL SH-AWD is also available with a six-speed manual, but only if they opt for the Technology Package. The Technology Package adds goodies such as navigation with voice commands, power moonroof, and Bluetooth, while the Advance Technology Package further adds a rearview camera, real-time traffic, and keyless entry.Body style: SedanEngines: 3.5L V-6, 3.7L V-6Transmissions: 6-speed manual, 6-speed automaticModels: TL, TL SH-AWD, TL SH-AWD manualThe 2012 Acura TL receives a much-needed face-lift, bringing the styling more in line with its luxurious character. The front and rear ends have been revised, and there are new 17-and 18-inch wheel designs. Also new is a six-speed automatic, helping the TL gain three more mpgs on the highway for front-drive models. Engines are unchanged, with the AWD model's 305-hp 3.7-liter V-6 still topping the range. The interior has been refined, and the cabin is quieter.The silver ""beak"" has been toned down and is positioned lower on the body, and the fog light surrounds on the lower front fascia have also been revised. The headlights have been updated, as well, and the front overhang is now shorter. A new design for the 17- and 18-inch wheels now have a revised center cap with a chrome-plated Acura ""A."" From behind, the 2012 TL sees a small number of small changes. There's a new diffuser at the bottom of the rear bumper, and the license plate area has moved upward a bit. Two new character lines have also been added to the rear bumper.Inside, the navigation system now has 60 gigabytes of storage and map coverage is more expansive. The multi-information display monitor is brighter, and the USB connection speed is faster. New ventilated front seats are an option as part of the Advance Package, and Acura made the cabin even quieter, reducing NVH by 3 decibels at highway speeds. A new blind spot information system completes the interior changes on the TL. SH-AWD models get a sportier steering wheel and seats.The TL feels quick and test results prove this sedan can hustle, most likely a result of the new six-speed manual transmission that has optimized gear ratios. The 3.7-liter model needs just 5.3 seconds to reach 60 mph, which is only three-tenths slower than the Infiniti G37. The new six-speed automatic also improves efficiency by allowing double-kickdowns, meaning it can go from fifth to third gear. The six-speed manual transmission is still an option for those who start with the 3.7-liter V-6 and Acura's so-called super-handling all-wheel drive.Acura's Advanced Compatibility Engineering (ACE) body structure minimizes impact on frontal crashes. Six airbags and active head restraints for the driver and front passenger come standard as do various braking aids such as anti-lock brakes (ABS), electronic brake distribution (EBD), brake assist (BA) Stability and traction control also come standard, as does a tire pressure monitoring system. All seating positions have three point belts, while outboard passengers have side curtain airbags.

Reviews:   * The TLX is the definition of smart luxury if you value the driving experience and appreciate Acuras cutting edge technologies like 4-wheel steering or Super Handling All-Wheel Drive over the prestige bestowed by having a European badge on your cars nose. Source: KBB.com   * Quiet interior; good fuel economy ratings; sporty handling, particularly with all-wheel drive; plenty of features for the money. Source: Edmunds   * Introducing the all new 2015 Acura TLX. The TLX has been shaped and trimmed to reduce drag, lift, turbulence, and rolling resistance. Weight has been reduced by using lighter tougher metals such as aluminum and ultra high strength steel. The 8-Speed 2.4L engine with 206hp with 182 lb-ft of torque has a Dual Clutch Transmission making upshifts and downshifts swift and seamless. Also available is a 9-Speed 3.5L V6 with 290hp and 267 lb-ft of torque featuring Variable Cylinder Management which lets the engine transition to three cylinders at cruising speeds enhancing fuel efficiency. Standard Precision All-Wheel Steer delivers unprecedented handling and is the first system that enables the rear wheels to adjust toe angles independently. Super Handling All-Wheel Drive is also available to direct engine power to match weight distribution. 10 stunning Jewel Eye LED headlights appear like gems in a jeweler's case and light up the night. The beauty continues inside with lit analog gauges and the On Demand Multi-Use Display touchscreen which controls audio and climate functions. The Audio System with a 15GB HDD media storage and 7 speakers allows functionality with multiple sources including USB, CD, Sirius XM, and Pandora. Also available is a 10 speaker premium system by ELS Studio. The Acura Navigation System uses hard drive data for ultra-fast response on the 8-inch screen and can display menus, maps and directions along with additional features such as Zagat restaurant reviews and real-time traffic. Acoustic noise-dampening foam introduced into the unibody provides vault-like silence. Available safety features include lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, blind spot warnings, and parking sensors.

It is a detail-oriented valued classic that has also been given the right recent investments to keep it running strong.  This was the final year and final evolution for the original run of Shelby Mustangs. They remain highly collectable today because the design really brought out the aggression we all wanted from these performance-built pony cars. You immediately see it in the front end with a large overhang to hide the headlights like prying eyes. The deep chin spoiler, correct competition-style wheels, and sports stripes running the full length of the car really add to this attitude. Plus, the factory-correct Black Jade paint has the right dark and intimidating attitude. It's a later respray, and so it has a good gloss without taking away from the highly original feel of this coupe. It was the darkest GT350 color offered by the factory, but when the sunlight hits it, the green undertones really come out for a cool finish. In fact, these GT350s are known for keep their cool, literally. There's three NACA ducts on the hood, two hood heat extractors, and inlets to rush air over every single wheel/brake. The rear end has plenty of iconic pieces, too. You have sporty details, like the center-exit dual exhaust and integrated full-width rear spoiler. Plus, the sequential tail lights are a true premium touch to give this one added distinction.  One look inside, and you can tell this is a classic built for performance. After all, you get the premium high-back bucket seats with the knit pattern and a cool red racing stripe across the top. Sporty Shelby upgrades included a roll bar with shoulder harnesses, and a center console with its auxiliary gauges angled towards the driver. The optional Sport Deck rear seat even folds flat for the proper racer look. But Ford's aim in 1970 was to make sure that when their customers paid a premium for these Shelbys that they got a premium feeling, too. That's why you got the wood-like treatment in the doors and dash. And you really get to understand what these cars were all about, because this interior is quite correct and preserved.  The final evolution of the GT350 was upgraded to Ford's portent 351 cubic-inch V8. The consig",,la,29.9605,-90.0753,new orleans

Kelley Blue Book is a registered trademark of Kelley Blue Book Co., Inc.*Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.Reviews:  * The TLX is the definition of smart luxury if you value the driving experience and appreciate Acuraâ  s cutting edge technologies like 4-wheel steering or Super Handling All-Wheel Drive over the prestige bestowed by having a European badge on your carâ  s nose. Source: KBB.com  * Quiet interior; good fuel economy ratings; sporty handling, particularly with all-wheel drive; plenty of features for the money. Source: Edmunds  * Introducing the all new 2015 Acura TLX. The TLX has been shaped and trimmed to reduce drag, lift, turbulence, and rolling resistance. Weight has been reduced by using lighter tougher metals such as aluminum and ultra high strength steel. The 8-Speed 2.4L engine with 206hp with 182 lb-ft of torque has a Dual Clutch Transmission making upshifts and downshifts swift and seamless. Also available is a 9-Speed 3.5L V6 with 290hp and 267 lb-ft of torque featuring Variable Cylinder Management which lets the engine transition to three cylinders at cruising speeds enhancing fuel efficiency. Standard Precision All-Wheel Steer delivers unprecedented handling and is the first system that enables the rear wheels to adjust toe angles independently. Super Handling All-Wheel Drive is also available to direct engine power to match weight distribution. 10 stunning Jewel Eye LED headlights appear like gems in a jeweler's case and light up the night. The beauty continues inside with lit analog gauges and the On Demand Multi-Use Display touchscreen which controls audio and climate functions.

Clean CARFAX. 2015 Acura TLX 3.5L V6 w/Technology PackageReviews:  * The TLX is the definition of smart luxury if you value the driving experience and appreciate Acura’s cutting edge technologies like 4-wheel steering or Super Handling All-Wheel Drive over the prestige bestowed by having a European badge on your car’s nose. Source: KBB.com  * Quiet interior; good fuel economy ratings; sporty handling, particularly with all-wheel drive; plenty of features for the money. Source: Edmunds  * Introducing the all new 2015 Acura TLX. The TLX has been shaped and trimmed to reduce drag, lift, turbulence, and rolling resistance. Weight has been reduced by using lighter tougher metals such as aluminum and ultra high strength steel. The 8-Speed 2.4L engine with 206hp with 182 lb-ft of torque has a Dual Clutch Transmission making upshifts and downshifts swift and seamless. Also available is a 9-Speed 3.5L V6 with 290hp and 267 lb-ft of torque featuring Variable Cylinder Management which lets the engine transition to three cylinders at cruising speeds enhancing fuel efficiency. Standard Precision All-Wheel Steer delivers unprecedented handling and is the first system that enables the rear wheels to adjust toe angles independently. Super Handling All-Wheel Drive is also available to direct engine power to match weight distribution. 10 stunning Jewel Eye LED headlights appear like gems in a jeweler's case and light up the night. The beauty continues inside with lit analog gauges and the On Demand Multi-Use Display touchscreen which controls audio and climate functions. The Audio System with a 15GB HDD media storage and 7 speakers allows functionality with multiple sources including USB, CD, Sirius XM, and Pandora. Also available is a 10 speaker premium system by ELS Studio. The Acura Navigation System uses hard drive data for ultra-fast response on the 8-inch screen and can display menus, maps and directions along with additional features such as Zagat restaurant reviews and real-time traffic. Acoustic noise-dampening foam introduced into the unibody provides vault-like silence. Available safety features include lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, blind spot warnings, and parking sensors.

38500,1970,chevrolet,corvette convertible,excellent,8 cylinders,gas,96403,194670S409570,rwd,convertible,"Reluctantly, I am posting my 1970 Corvette convertible. I have owned this car for 20 years. I restored it myself as I own an automotive repair facility. It has a 350ci engine with roller rockers moderate lift cam and a new Edelbrock 650 cfm carburetor. Ignition has been upgraded to Mallory electronic high output distributor , coil and wires. It is automatic transmission. I installed these upgrades:  Vintage air conditioning Power rack and pinion steering, fiberglass monoleaf rear springs. New front coil springs New shock absorbers. It is sitting on 18X 8 American Racing polished Torque Thrust II Wheels and 4 Toyo HP tires. The interior has been re- done and a new top was installed during restoration. The paint is in very good shape, not quite show perfect, but close. It runs and drives great as the new springs give it a soft ride unlike stock multileaf steel springs. Everything works except the odometer which stopped a few years back at 96403 miles. Tach and speedometer work accurately. Custom Flowmaster exhaust give it a mean sounding idle. There are too many upgrades and additions to list here. This is a RARE classic that turns heads everywhere I go.  This is NOT a numbers matching engine. It is a completely rebuilt 350ci 4 bolt main with approximately 350 hp. Always garage kept. This car was built to drive and enjoy. Similar Corvettes are selling for much more money. Check Google listings and you will see what a bargain this car is. A great investment in today's market and well as so much fun to drive and show off. No low ball offers. You must see this car to appreciate it.  Serious inquiries only.",,nc,35.922,-80.537,winston-salem

Source: KBB.com  * Generous number of standard features; balanced approach to ride quality and handling ability. Source: Edmunds  * The 2014 Acura ILX offers sporty performance and style in one attractive package. It is available with a 2.0 or 2.4-liter i-VTEC Engine or an Integrated Motor Assist System which is comprised of a 1.5-liter i-VTEC gasoline engine with an electric motor if you opt to purchase the ILX Hybrid. The 2.0-liter i-VTEC Engine boasts an impressive 150 Horsepower while maintaining a fuel efficiency of 24 MPG City, 35 MPG Freeway, and 28 MPG combined. If you're looking for more power, the optional 2.4-liter Engine, exclusively connected to the 6-Speed manual transmission, is rated at a powerful 201 Horsepower with fuel economy of 22 MPG City, 31 MPG Freeway, and 25 MPG combined. The Integrated Motor Assist System on the hybrid produces 111 Horsepower and has a fuel efficiency of 39 MPG City, and 38 MPG Freeway, and 38 MPG combined. Further, the ILX Hybrid utilizes technology that is able to use the brakes and deceleration to actually recharge the battery for the electric motor to use later. Step inside, and you will relax in comfort and style in the plush seats that are ergonomically designed to provide the support to keep you comfortable even on long road trips. Also standard is Bluetooth, pushbutton start, and the convenience of dual-zone climate controls for the driver and front passenger to enjoy. Plus, you also receive an innovative text message function that will read your texts to you and supply your choice of six pre-loaded responses or the ability to call back the person who sent the message in the first place.

The truck had 27700 miles on it when i bought it (highway driver, no hauling) and i put the 5th Wheel hitch on it and bought the 2019 Winnebago NEW last summer from the same dealer at the same time. Everything about the 5th Wheel (from hitch to rear bumper) is in like-new shape (some stickers still on the appliances). I have only towed the trailer about 8000 - 9000 miles and it has virtually no wear/tear. I was stored from November until May. I pulled the trailer from Washington to Colorado to Texas and back to Washington three times for work, the rest of the mileage is long highway commutes. My job changed and i don't need it anymore.   Truck: 2019 F350 Super Duty Lariat Package (fully loaded) New Tires at ~40,000 miles, and they are in great shape, as i've towed very little and only drive on the freeway.  I had Ford add the F350 front end stabilizer upgrade, although the trailer pulls straight (belt & suspenders) Long list of options included, fully decked out I take care of my equipment and you'll find nothing but road dust on this beauty.   5th Wheel Hitch: Reese 20K Adjustable Track for tight manuvering  Trailer: 2019 Winnebago Minnie Plus 5th Wheel Model# 29RBH 2019C VIN# 54CFM4Y2XK4024684 Bought NEW 6/27/2020 (same time as i bought the truck) Exterior: Platinum Interior: Pearl Theater Seating Extreme Weather Package RVIA Tag Wide Screen TV Electric Fireplace/Heater Bunk House Two Slide Outs Two Doors Bathroom for Privacy Queen Bed Three Bunks and Storage in Bunk House Lots of Storage Everywhere Leveling Blocks Electric rear stabilizers Back Up Camera Out Door Shower Out Door Fridge and Stove Top LPG Connection for BBQ LPG & Electric Heat Two Air Conditioners LED lighting Full Electric Awning (never used) I proactively replaced the tires at 5000 miles. They are top quality E rated tires. All Cords/plugs/etc are of the highest quality (over $2000 of stuff)  See video here (not my trailer, just off of YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7jkoE0_JZI  Full Details on the Trailer Model: https://www.rvusa.com/rv-guide/2019-winnebago-minnie-plus-fifth-wheel-floorplan-29rbh-tr39785   Please inquire only if you have decided that is set up is what you want. I am crazy busy and really just want to work with someone if they love the rig.   I don't need the trailer and the truck is a BEAST of a machine. Best 1-Ton Puller on the road, as can be attested to by all the guys at the fuel stops who i talked to. The F350 Super Duty tows the trailer like magic and i was never under powered or under-braked.   Generator: https://www.cummins.com/generators/onan-p4500i-inverter-portable-generator  I have a hella good Cummings generator that i will negotiate on but they are sold out and very hard to find, for good reason. Bought it at Power Generation Service in Albuquerque, still under warranty. It is NOT for sale with the rig, but would consider adding it into the package if its really important to the buyer.   The rig is currently in Bellingham WA. I will deliver to Anchorage on the Ferry or you can pick up. I will also Deliver to the Western United States if need be.",ak,61.19,-149.8938,anchorage / mat-su

According to the web site MBZPonton.org, only 1,251 Coupes (Chassis Code:W180.037) were produced. The site notes, “There are rare instances of Ponton Coupes and sedans (extremely rare) fitted with steel sunroofs made by Webasto,” however, “a Ponton coupe with a steel sunroof does not have a unique chassis code prefix therefore no one knows how many Ponton coupes were produced with sunroofs.   The most valuable Pontons were the six-cylinder models; the powerful 220s was manufactured from March 1956 through September 1959, this model came in sedan, coupe and cabriolet versions. This car (Vin # 180 037 Z 85 13 070) was delivered February 9, 1958 and has both the factory sunroof and the Hydrak  transmission. The Hydrak was a technological way point between a manual and the fully automatic transmissions that followed. The Hydrak  shifts manually but without a clutch pedal, proving once again that the more things change the more they stay the same ! The combination of the factory sunroof and Hydrak transmission make this car VERY rare. Experts estimate the number of sunroof equipped coupes produced as low as 35 units during the three year Ponton production cycle, with an even smaller number having the Hydrak option.   This car runs and drives nicely and is a pleasure to be in or seen in.  This 1958 Mercedes Benz  220S Coupe is  exempt from California smog certification and comes with a clean California title.
